# TNFSHSU

Made with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com), with the [Astroad](https://github.com/mooxl/astroad) template.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started this repo, make sure you have the necessary software installed:

- Docker
- Node.js (with npm)

## Configuration

While there's no configuration necessary for local development, deployment via Github Workflows requires specific secrets and variables to be set.

***Github Workflows deployment is currently disabled***

### Secrets:

- `USER`: User on the server
- `HOST`: IP or URL of the server
- `KEY`: SSH KEY for connecting to the server
- `MONGODB_PW`: Password for MongoDB
- `MONGODB_USER`: User for MongoDB
- `PATH`: Path where the repository resides on the server
- `PAYLOAD_PORT`: Port at which Payload listens
- `PAYLOAD_SECRET`: String to encrypt Payload data
- `TOKEN`: Github Access Token for the webhook to trigger the payload.yml workflow and execute a new Astro build

### Variables:

- `ASTRO_HOST`: Hostdomain of the Frontend
- `PAYLOAD_HOST`: Hostdomain of the CMS
- `PAYLOAD_URL`: URL of the CMS
- `NAME`: Name of the Container and Project

Please remember to set these secrets and variables in your repository settings to ensure a successful deployment through Github Workflows.

Once the secrets and variables are set on GitHub, they will replace the existing ones in the `.env` file on the server during deployment. This is done by the push.yml workflow, which replaces the placeholders in the `.env` with the actual secrets and variables defined in the repository settings. Please ensure that the names of your secrets and variables match with the placeholders in the `.env` file.

## Getting started

To get started with this repo, you'll need to have Docker and NPM (or other managers) installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/tnfshcec/tnfshsu.git`
2. Change into the repository directory: `cd tnfshsu`
3. Start the containers: `npm run dev`

This will start up the Astro, Payloadcms and Mongo containers and make them available on your local machine. Astro will be served at http://localhost:4321 and the Payload will be available at http://localhost:3001.

## Development

The `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-dev.yml` files includes everything you need to run the containers. The containers use the environment variables declared in the `.env` file and mounted volumes to store data persistently even after the containers are stopped and started.

## Deployment

~~Deployment is handled by a Github Actions Workflow on every push. It logs into the server via SSH, pulls or clones the latest version of the repository, and runs `yarn prod`.~~

~~Because Astro is completely static, a content change in the CMS must trigger a new build of Astro. Therefore, thereâ€™s a `payload.yml` workflow that gets triggered by a webhook after every content change from Payload.~~

~~Ensure you have Traefik set up as a reverse proxy before deployment. The prod script will launch your site in a production-ready environment.~~
